SVM-quasars
===========


Identification of quasars behind the Andromeda Galaxy using SVM and logistic regression. The author was able to successfully boost the number of known quasars behind the Andromeda galaxy by a factor of 4, with a significantly improved precision of 90% (from 8% in traditional methods) to save telescope time.

It uses data from the Palomar Transient Factory and some public astronomical archives. The code includes the following steps:

    1. Data formatting
    
    2. Feature selection
    
    3. Feature visualization
    
    4. Parameter tuning in classifiers
    
    5. Classification
    
    6. Validation
