SVM-quasars
===========


Identify quasars behind the Andromeda Galaxy using SVM and logistic regression, including the following steps:

    1. Formatting the data
    
    2. Feature selection
    
    3. Feature visualization
    
    4. Parameter tuning in classifiers
    
    5. Classification
    
    6. Validation

It uses data from the Palomar Transient Factory and some public astronomical archives. 

It successfully boosted the number of known quasars behind the Andromeda galaxy by a factor of 4, with a significantly improved precision of 90% (from 8% in traditional methods) to save telescope time. More details of the results can be found at: http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~stang/m31qso
